      Hi, I'm Hershraj. I work as a Member of Technical Staff (on the AI/ML team) at a currently stealth-mode startup.
    </p>

    <p>
      Previously, I worked on graph algorithms and agentic systems at Virio. I also interned as a machine learning
      engineer at Property Finder, where I worked on deep learning models for real estate price forecasting. I also
      spent a summer at The Residency, where I tackled technical challenges with enterprise-scale AI. On the side, I
      am wrapping up my EECS undergrad degree at UC Berkeley.
    </p>

    <p>
      At BAIR, my research focused on LLM-guided program synthesis and interpretable ML, especially on navigating
      large combinatorial search spaces. I've also worked on time series forecasting and physics-informed models.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a lot of experience working with LLMs, training/deploying machine learning models, and building scalable
      software. Feel free to reach out!
    </p>
