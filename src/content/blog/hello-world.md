Welcome to my blog! I've been meaning to start writing more about my experiences in tech, research, and life in general[^1]. 

## Topics I'll Cover

- **Machine Learning & AI**: Deep dives into interesting papers, techniques, and my own experiments[^transformers]
- **Research**: Summaries of my work and interesting findings in the field
- **Personal**: Occasionally, reflections on life, productivity, and growth

## Why Start a Blog?

Writing helps me think more clearly[^2]. Also my dad has been pushing me to make one of these for a while. Might as well give it a shot!

I'll try to make a few posts here or there. Whatever happens happens!

**Thanks for reading. More to come soon!**

[^1]: This is something I've wanted to do for years but kept procrastinating on.
[^2]: There's actually research supporting this—the act of writing forces you to organize your thoughts in a way that just thinking doesn't.
[^transformers]: Particularly interested in attention mechanisms and their applications beyond NLP.
